## Review

- - You are working on a team of climate scientists and one of your roles is to take the weekly temperature data and input into NumPy arrays for later analysis. The sensor records the temperature 4 times a day, at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, and 18:00. You are given last weeks data (Monday through Friday) and asked to create a NumPy array.
- 
- Get started by importing the numpy package.
- 
- Checkpoint 2 Passed
- - Create an array temperatures by importing the data in the CSV temperature_data.csv
- 
- (CSV based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
- 
- Checkpoint 3 Passed
- - Inspect the data by printing it to the terminal.
- 
- The columns are the times, starting at 0:00, and the rows are days, starting on Monday, and the values are the recorded temperatures at that time on those days.
- 
- Checkpoint 4 Passed
- - One of the researchers noticed that the sensor had been incorrectly zeroed and all of the recorded temperatures are 3.0 degrees too cold.
- 
- Adjust the array so that the temperature readings are accurate and save them to temperatures_fixed.
- 
- Checkpoint 5 Passed
- - Another researcher asked you for the temperature values from Monday. Save them to a new array, monday_temperatures.
- 
- Checkpoint 6 Passed
- - “Hmmm, interesting” the researcher mumbles, “can you also give me the 6:00 AM data for Thursday and Friday?”
- 
- Save this data to a new array thursday_friday_morning.
- 
- Checkpoint 7 Passed
- - Finally, the persistent researcher now wants all the high and low temperatures over the week.
- 
- Select all temperatures that are under 50 degrees or over 60 degrees and save them to a new array temperature_extremes.
